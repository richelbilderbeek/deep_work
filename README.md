## The book

Deep Work, by Cal Newport

> focus is the new I.Q. in the modern workplace.

## Cal Newport

From Wikipedia:

Dr. Calvin Newport (born June 23, 1982), known as Cal Newport, 
is an associate professor of computer science (with tenure)[1] at Georgetown University 
and the author of six self-improvement books. 
He also writes the Study Hacks blog focused on academic and career success.[2] 

## The Idea

> Deep work: professional activities performed in a state of
> distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive
> abilities to their limit. These efforts create new value,
> improve your skill, and are hard to replicate   

> Shallow work: noncognitively demanding, logistical-style
> tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts
> tend to not create much new value in the world and are
> easy to replicate

> The Deep Work Hypothesis: the ability to perform deep 
> work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same
> time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our
> economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this
> skill, and then make it the core of their working life,
> will thrive.
